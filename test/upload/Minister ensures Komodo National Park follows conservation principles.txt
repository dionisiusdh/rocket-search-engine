The Environmental Affairs and Forestry (KLHK) Ministry has made assurance that the development of facilities and infrastructure to support tourism at the Komodo National Park, East Nusa Tenggara (NTT), aligns with the principles of conservation.

The construction work was conducted with utmost care, Wiratno, the ministry's Director General of Conservation of Natural Resources and Ecosystems, noted in a statement here on Wednesday.

Facilities and infrastructure being constructed at Pasir Panjang Village, Komodo Sub-district, West Manggarai District, NTT, comprise a pier, beach guard facility, deck, and information center, as well as huts for officers, researchers, or guides, Wiratno remarked.

Trucks, excavators, and heavy equipment required to carry construction material are used with the application of the principle of prudence, he stated.

In the construction area of Loh Buaya, some 15 Komodo dragons, the world's surviving giant lizards, often roam around, and some are accustomed to human presence.

"In order to ensure the safety and protection of Komodo dragons as well as the workers, all development activities are monitored daily by five to 10 rangers. They intensively monitor the presence of Komodo dragons, including under buildings, former buildings, and under trucks carrying materials," he remarked.

The ministry temporarily closed the Loh Buaya Resort for tourism activities from Oct 26, 2020, to June 30, 2021, owing to the construction work.

Other tourist spots on Komodo Island, Karang Makasar, Batubolang, Siaba, and Mawan remain open to the public, including to tourists.
